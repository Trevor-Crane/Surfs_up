# Surfs_up

## Overview of Project
I am looking into possibly opening a surf and ice cream shop in the island of Oahu in Hawaii. In order to convince possible investors, I need to prove that this kind of shop could be sustainable year round. In order to do that, I will determine summary statistics regarding temperatures for the month of June, and compare them to the month of December.

## Results
After collecting data regarding temperatures in the Island of Oahu, I was able to come up with these figures:

![June_Temps](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107770394/185205048-85af7b38-0bc3-45a0-a929-2bae4e05dc6b.png) ![Dec_Temps](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107770394/185205104-889803dc-0e8e-47ce-98c3-13da07ecdeb8.png)

In summary:
* The average temp in June is about 75F vs 71F in December
* The minimum temp in June is 64F vs 56F in December
* The Maximum temp in June is 85F vs 83 in December

### Summary of Temps
Looking at these, it is fair to say temperature wise, there isn't to much of a variance to deter the flow fo customers between summer and winter months. With a difference of 4 degrees as an average temperature, that isn't to much of a concern. The only concern would be the minimum temperature difference. With a difference of 8 degrees though, it isn't ot much to deter customers. Although Ice Cream sells may not be as high in the 50's, it is still quallity surfing weather.

## Looking at Precipitation
I decided to go a step further, and look at the summary statistics with precipitation for the months of June and December as well, and came up with the following:

In summary:
* The average rainfall per day is 0.14 inches in June vs 0.22 inches in December
* Both months have a minimum of 0 inches of rain
* June has had a maximum of 4.43 inches of rain vs 6.42 in December

### Summary of Precipitation
Looking at these, there isn't to much difference in rainfall as well. Both months have a high maximum, but with both their averages being below a quarter of an inch, it wouldn't effect it to greatly. 

## Grand Summary
With both of these data sets in my disposal, it shouldn't be to hard to prove to possible investors that this would be a worthy investment. With The differences in both tempreatures and precipitation both being as low as they are, I have proved my sure and ice cream shop could be sustainable year round.
