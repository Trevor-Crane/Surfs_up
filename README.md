# Surfs_up

## Overview of Project
I am looking into possibly opening a surf and ice cream shop in the island of Oahu in Hawaii. In order to convince possible investors, I need to prove that this kind of shop could be sustainable year round. In order to do that, I will determine summary statistics for the month of June, and compare them to the month of December.
